# About this page

Welcome to my contest math page! I hope the content here is of some use to you. If you want to give me any feedback or have any questions please email me at jamie(at)theeyrie.co.uk

This was made using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and it is hosted on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). You can see the github repository with all the relevant files [here](https://github.com/jamiecayley/abstractalgebra). The design is based on the [BlackDoc theme](http://karloespiritu.com/blackdoc/), the syntax highlighting is based on [base 16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) 

# About the content

Given the nature of the subject most of the content will be problem focused. I'll provide the information needed to work out the problems listed in every section and a lot of exercises. In the future I might include worked out solutions to all the problems but for now the page will be more of an exercise book than a learning resource. 

# About me

My name is Jamie and I'm an MMath student at the University of Surrey. Before being a student at Surrey I spent a year studing math at UC Berkeley and before then I was self-schooled. As of last year I thought the focus of my mathematical career would be abstract algebra but since then I took an introductory real analysis class which I really enjoyed, so I guess we'll see where things go from here.
